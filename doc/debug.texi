@node printf
@section @code{printf()}

Don't underestimate the value of @func{printf}.  The way
@func{printf} is implemented in Pintos, you can call it from
practically anywhere in the kernel, whether it's in a kernel thread or
an interrupt handler, almost regardless of what locks are held.

@func{printf} is useful for more than just examining data.
It can also help figure out when and where something goes wrong, even
when the kernel crashes or panics without a useful error message.  The
strategy is to sprinkle calls to @func{printf} with different strings
(e.g.@: @code{"<1>"}, @code{"<2>"}, @dots{}) throughout the pieces of
code you suspect are failing.  If you don't even see @code{<1>} printed,
then something bad happened before that point, if you see @code{<1>}
but not @code{<2>}, then something bad happened between those two
points, and so on.  Based on what you learn, you can then insert more
@func{printf} calls in the new, smaller region of code you suspect.
Eventually you can narrow the problem down to a single statement.
@xref{Triple Faults}, for a related technique.

@node ASSERT
@section @code{ASSERT}

Assertions are useful because they can catch problems early, before
they'd otherwise be noticed.  Ideally, each function should begin with a
set of assertions that check its arguments for validity.  (Initializers
for functions' local variables are evaluated before assertions are
checked, so be careful not to assume that an argument is valid in an
initializer.)  You can also sprinkle assertions throughout the body of
functions in places where you suspect things are likely to go wrong.
They are especially useful for checking loop invariants.

Pintos provides the @code{ASSERT} macro, defined in @file{<debug.h>},
for checking assertions.

@defmac ASSERT (expression)
Tests the value of @var{expression}.  If it evaluates to zero (false),
the kernel panics.  The panic message includes the expression that
failed, its file and line number, and a backtrace, which should help you
to find the problem.  @xref{Backtraces}, for more information.
@end defmac

@node Function and Parameter Attributes
@section Function and Parameter Attributes

These macros defined in @file{<debug.h>} tell the compiler special
attributes of a function or function parameter.  Their expansions are
GCC-specific.

@defmac UNUSED
Appended to a function parameter to tell the compiler that the
parameter might not be used within the function.  It suppresses the
warning that would otherwise appear.
@end defmac

@defmac NO_RETURN
Appended to a function prototype to tell the compiler that the
function never returns.  It allows the compiler to fine-tune its
warnings and its code generation.
@end defmac

@defmac NO_INLINE
Appended to a function prototype to tell the compiler to never emit
the function in-line.  Occasionally useful to improve the quality of
backtraces (see below).
@end defmac

@defmac PRINTF_FORMAT (@var{format}, @var{first})
Appended to a function prototype to tell the compiler that the function
takes a @func{printf}-like format string as the argument numbered
@var{format} (starting from 1) and that the corresponding value
arguments start at the argument numbered @var{first}.  This lets the
compiler tell you if you pass the wrong argument types.
@end defmac

@node Backtraces
@section Backtraces

When the kernel panics, it prints a ``backtrace,'' that is, a summary
of how your program got where it is, as a list of addresses inside the
functions that were running at the time of the panic.  You can also
insert a call to @func{debug_backtrace}, prototyped in
@file{<debug.h>}, to print a backtrace at any point in your code.
@func{debug_backtrace_all}, also declared in @file{<debug.h>}, 
prints backtraces of all threads.

The addresses in a backtrace are listed as raw hexadecimal numbers,
which are difficult to interpret.  We provide a tool called
@command{backtrace} to translate these into function names and source
file line numbers.
Give it the name of your @file{kernel.o} as the first argument and the
hexadecimal numbers composing the backtrace (including the @samp{0x}
prefixes) as the remaining arguments.  It outputs the function name
and source file line numbers that correspond to each address.  

If the translated form of a backtrace is garbled, or doesn't make
sense (e.g.@: function A is listed above function B, but B doesn't
call A), then it's a good sign that you're corrupting a kernel
thread's stack, because the backtrace is extracted from the stack.
Alternatively, it could be that the @file{kernel.o} you passed to
@command{backtrace} is not the same kernel that produced
the backtrace.

Sometimes backtraces can be confusing without any corruption.
Compiler optimizations can cause surprising behavior.  When a function
has called another function as its final action (a @dfn{tail call}), the
calling function may not appear in a backtrace at all.  Similarly, when
function A calls another function B that never returns, the compiler may
optimize such that an unrelated function C appears in the backtrace
instead of A.  Function C is simply the function that happens to be in
memory just after A.  In the threads task, this is commonly seen in
backtraces for test failures; see @ref{The pass function fails, ,
@func{pass} fails}, for more information.

@menu
* Backtrace Example::           
@end menu

@node Backtrace Example
@subsection Example

Here's an example.  Suppose that Pintos printed out this following call
stack, which is taken from an actual Pintos submission:

@example
Call stack: 0xc0106eff 0xc01102fb 0xc010dc22 0xc010cf67 0xc0102319
0xc010325a 0x804812c 0x8048a96 0x8048ac8.
@end example

You would then invoke the @command{backtrace} utility like shown below,
cutting and pasting the backtrace information into the command line.
This assumes that @file{kernel.o} is in the current directory.  You
would of course enter all of the following on a single shell command
line, even though that would overflow our margins here:

@example
backtrace kernel.o 0xc0106eff 0xc01102fb 0xc010dc22 0xc010cf67 
0xc0102319 0xc010325a 0x804812c 0x8048a96 0x8048ac8
@end example

The backtrace output would then look something like this:

@example
0xc0106eff: debug_panic (lib/debug.c:86)
0xc01102fb: file_seek (filesys/file.c:405)
0xc010dc22: seek (userprog/syscall.c:744)
0xc010cf67: syscall_handler (userprog/syscall.c:444)
0xc0102319: intr_handler (threads/interrupt.c:334)
0xc010325a: intr_entry (threads/intr-stubs.S:38)
0x0804812c: (unknown)
0x08048a96: (unknown)
0x08048ac8: (unknown)
@end example

(You will probably not see exactly the same addresses if you run the
command above on your own kernel binary, because the source code you
compiled and the compiler you used are probably different.)

The first line in the backtrace refers to @func{debug_panic}, the
function that implements kernel panics.  Because backtraces commonly
result from kernel panics, @func{debug_panic} will often be the first
function shown in a backtrace.

The second line shows @func{file_seek} as the function that panicked,
in this case as the result of an assertion failure.  In the source code
tree used for this example, line 405 of @file{filesys/file.c} is the
assertion

@example
ASSERT (file_ofs >= 0);
@end example

@noindent
(This line was also cited in the assertion failure message.)
Thus, @func{file_seek} panicked because it passed a negative file offset
argument.

The third line indicates that @func{seek} called @func{file_seek},
presumably without validating the offset argument.  In this submission,
@func{seek} implements the @code{seek} system call.

The fourth line shows that @func{syscall_handler}, the system call
handler, invoked @func{seek}.

The fifth and sixth lines are the interrupt handler entry path.

The remaining lines are for addresses below @code{PHYS_BASE}.  This
means that they refer to addresses in the user program, not in the
kernel.  If you know what user program was running when the kernel
panicked, you can re-run @command{backtrace} on the user program, like
so: (typing the command on a single line, of course):

@example
backtrace tests/filesys/extended/grow-too-big 0xc0106eff 0xc01102fb
0xc010dc22 0xc010cf67 0xc0102319 0xc010325a 0x804812c 0x8048a96
0x8048ac8
@end example

The results look like this:

@example
0xc0106eff: (unknown)
0xc01102fb: (unknown)
0xc010dc22: (unknown)
0xc010cf67: (unknown)
0xc0102319: (unknown)
0xc010325a: (unknown)
0x0804812c: test_main (...xtended/grow-too-big.c:20)
0x08048a96: main (tests/main.c:10)
0x08048ac8: _start (lib/user/entry.c:9)
@end example

You can even specify both the kernel and the user program names on
the command line, like so:

@example
backtrace kernel.o tests/filesys/extended/grow-too-big 0xc0106eff
0xc01102fb 0xc010dc22 0xc010cf67 0xc0102319 0xc010325a 0x804812c
0x8048a96 0x8048ac8
@end example

The result is a combined backtrace:

@example
In kernel.o:
0xc0106eff: debug_panic (lib/debug.c:86)
0xc01102fb: file_seek (filesys/file.c:405)
0xc010dc22: seek (userprog/syscall.c:744)
0xc010cf67: syscall_handler (userprog/syscall.c:444)
0xc0102319: intr_handler (threads/interrupt.c:334)
0xc010325a: intr_entry (threads/intr-stubs.S:38)
In tests/filesys/extended/grow-too-big:
0x0804812c: test_main (...xtended/grow-too-big.c:20)
0x08048a96: main (tests/main.c:10)
0x08048ac8: _start (lib/user/entry.c:9)
@end example

Here's an extra tip for anyone who read this far: @command{backtrace}
is smart enough to strip the @code{Call stack:} header and @samp{.}
trailer from the command line if you include them.  This can save you
a little bit of trouble in cutting and pasting.  Thus, the following
command prints the same output as the first one we used:

@example
backtrace kernel.o Call stack: 0xc0106eff 0xc01102fb 0xc010dc22
0xc010cf67 0xc0102319 0xc010325a 0x804812c 0x8048a96 0x8048ac8.
@end example

@node GDB
@section GDB

You can run Pintos under the supervision of the GDB debugger.
First, start Pintos with the @option{--gdb} option, e.g.@:
@command{pintos --gdb -- run mytest}.  Second, open a second terminal on
the same machine and
use @command{pintos-gdb} to invoke GDB on
@file{kernel.o}:@footnote{@command{pintos-gdb} is a wrapper around
@command{gdb} (80@var{x}86) that loads the Pintos macros at startup.}
@example
pintos-gdb kernel.o
@end example
@noindent and issue the following GDB command:
@example
target remote localhost:1234
@end example
@noindent or alternatively issue the following GDB macro:
@example
debugpintos
@end example

Now GDB is connected to the simulator over a local
network connection.  You can now issue any normal GDB
commands.  If you issue the @samp{c} command, the simulated BIOS will take
control, load Pintos, and then Pintos will run in the usual way.  You
can pause the process at any point with @key{Ctrl+C}.

@node Using GDB
@subsection Using GDB

You can read the GDB manual by typing @code{info gdb} at a
terminal command prompt.  Here's a few commonly useful GDB commands:

@deffn {GDB Command} c
Continues execution until @key{Ctrl+C} or the next breakpoint.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Command} break function
@deffnx {GDB Command} break file:line
@deffnx {GDB Command} break *address
Sets a breakpoint at @var{function}, at @var{line} within @var{file}, or
@var{address}.
(Use a @samp{0x} prefix to specify an address in hex.)

Use @code{break main} to make GDB stop when Pintos starts running.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Command} p expression
Evaluates the given @var{expression} and prints its value.
If the expression contains a function call, that function will actually
be executed.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Command} l *address
Lists a few lines of code around @var{address}.
(Use a @samp{0x} prefix to specify an address in hex.)
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Command} bt
Prints a stack backtrace similar to that output by the
@command{backtrace} program described above.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Command} p/a address
Prints the name of the function or variable that occupies @var{address}.
(Use a @samp{0x} prefix to specify an address in hex.)
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Command} diassemble function
Disassembles @var{function}.
@end deffn

We also provide a set of macros specialized for debugging Pintos,
written by Godmar Back @email{gback@@cs.vt.edu}.  You can type
@code{help user-defined} for basic help with the macros.  Here is an
overview of their functionality, based on Godmar's documentation:

@deffn {GDB Macro} debugpintos
Attach debugger to a waiting pintos process on the same machine.
Shorthand for @code{target remote localhost:1234}.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Macro} dumplist list type element
Prints the elements of @var{list}, which must be passed by reference and should be a @code{struct list}
that contains elements of the given @var{type} (without the word
@code{struct}) in which @var{element} is the @struct{list_elem} member
that links the elements.

Example: @code{dumplist &all_list thread allelem} prints all elements of
@struct{thread} that are linked in @code{struct list all_list} using the
@code{struct list_elem allelem} which is part of @struct{thread}.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Macro} btthread thread
Shows the backtrace of @var{thread}, which is a pointer to the
@struct{thread} of the thread whose backtrace it should show.  For the
current thread, this is identical to the @code{bt} (backtrace) command.
It also works for any thread suspended in @func{schedule},
provided you know where its kernel stack page is located.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Macro} btthreadlist list element
Shows the backtraces of all threads in @var{list}, which must be passed by reference and is the @struct{list} in which the threads are kept.  
Specify @var{element} as the @struct{list_elem} field used inside @struct{thread} to link the threads together.

Example: @code{btthreadlist &all_list allelem} shows the backtraces of
all threads contained in @code{struct list all_list}, linked together by
@code{allelem}.  This command is useful to determine where your threads
are stuck when a deadlock occurs.  Please see the example scenario below.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Macro} btthreadall
Short-hand for @code{btthreadlist all_list allelem}.
@end deffn

@deffn {GDB Macro} hook-stop
GDB invokes this macro every time the simulation stops, which QEMU will
do for every processor exception, among other reasons.  If the
simulation stops due to a page fault, @code{hook-stop} will print a
message that says and explains further whether the page fault occurred
in the kernel or in user code.

If the exception occurred from user code, @code{hook-stop} will say:
@example
pintos-debug: a page fault exception occurred in user mode
pintos-debug: hit 'c' to continue, or 's' to step to intr_handler
@end example

In Task 2, a page fault in a user process leads to the termination of
the process.  You should expect those page faults to occur in the
robustness tests where we test that your kernel properly terminates
processes that try to access invalid addresses.  To debug those, set a
break point in @func{page_fault} in @file{exception.c}, which you will
need to modify accordingly.

In Task 3, a page fault in a user process no longer automatically
leads to the termination of a process.  Instead, it may require reading in
data for the page the process was trying to access, either
because it was swapped out or because this is the first time it's
accessed.  In either case, you will reach @func{page_fault} and need to
take the appropriate action there.

If the page fault did not occur in user mode while executing a user
process, then it occurred in kernel mode while executing kernel code.
In this case, @code{hook-stop} will print this message:
@example
pintos-debug: a page fault occurred in kernel mode
@end example

Before Task 3, a page fault exception in kernel code is always a bug
in your kernel, because your kernel should never crash.  Starting with
Task 3, the situation will change if you use the @func{get_user} and
@func{put_user} strategy to verify user memory accesses
(@pxref{Accessing User Memory}).

@c ----
@c Unfortunately, this does not work with Bochs's gdb stub.
@c ----
@c If you don't want GDB to stop for page faults, then issue the command
@c @code{handle SIGSEGV nostop}.  GDB will still print a message for
@c every page fault, but it will not come back to a command prompt.
@end deffn

@node Example GDB Session
@subsection Example GDB Session

This section narrates a sample GDB session, provided by Godmar Back 
(modified by Mark Rutland and Feroz Abdul Salam, and updated by Fidelis Perkonigg).
This example illustrates how one might debug a Task 1 solution in
which occasionally a thread that calls @func{timer_sleep} is not woken
up.  With this bug, tests such as @code{mlfqs_load_1} get stuck.

Program output is shown in normal type, user input in @strong{strong}
type.

@noindent First, we start Pintos using the QEMU emulator:

@smallexample
@code{$ pintos -v --qemu --gdb -- -q -mlfqs run mlfqs-load-1}

qemu-system-i386 -drive file=/tmp/GKWoGG8QE6.dsk,index=0,media=disk,format=raw -m 4 -net none -nographic -s -S
@end smallexample

@noindent This starts QEMU but pauses the execution of Pintos immediately to
allow us to attach GDB to Pintos. We open a second window in the same directory
on the same machine and start GDB:

@smallexample
$ @strong{pintos-gdb kernel.o}

@end smallexample

@noindent Then, we tell GDB to attach to the waiting Pintos emulator:

@smallexample
(gdb) @strong{debugpintos}
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
@end smallexample

@noindent Now we instruct GDB to continue the execution of Pintos by using the
command @code{continue} (or the abbreviation @code{c}):

@smallexample
(gdb) @strong{c}
Continuing.
@end smallexample

@noindent Now Pintos will continue and output:

@smallexample
PiLo hda1

@end smallexample

@noindent 
... until it gets stuck due to the bug in the code.
We hit @key{Ctrl+C} in the debugger window to stop Pintos.

@smallexample
Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.

@end smallexample

@noindent 
The thread that was running when we stopped Pintos happened to be the main
thread.  If we run @code{backtrace}, it shows this backtrace:

@smallexample

#9  main () at ../../threads/init.c:133
@end smallexample

@noindent 
Not terribly useful.  What we really like to know is what's up with the
other thread (or threads).  Since we keep all threads in a linked list
called @code{all_list}, linked together by a @struct{list_elem} member
named @code{allelem}, we can use the @code{btthreadlist} macro.
@code{btthreadlist} iterates through the list of threads and prints the
backtrace for each thread:

@smallexample

@end smallexample

@noindent 
In this case, there are only two threads, the main thread and the idle
thread.  The kernel stack pages (to which the @struct{thread} points)
are at @t{0xc000e000} and @t{0xc0103000}, respectively.  The main thread
was in @func{timer_elapsed}, called from @code{test_mlfqs_load_1} when stopped.

Knowing where threads are can be tremendously useful, for instance
when diagnosing deadlocks or unexplained hangs.

@deffn {GDB Macro} loadusersymbols

You can also use GDB to debug a user program running under Pintos.  
To do that, use the @code{loadusersymbols} macro to load the program's 
symbol table:
@example
loadusersymbols @var{program}
@end example
@noindent
where @var{program} is the name of the program's executable (in the host
file system, not in the Pintos file system).  For example, you may issue:
@smallexample
(gdb) @strong{loadusersymbols tests/userprog/exec-multiple}
add symbol table from file "tests/userprog/exec-multiple" at
    .text_addr = 0x80480a0
(gdb) 
@end smallexample

After this, you should be
able to debug the user program the same way you would the kernel, by
placing breakpoints, inspecting data, etc.  Your actions apply to every
user program running in Pintos, not just to the one you want to debug,
so be careful in interpreting the results:  GDB does not know
which process is currently active (because that is an abstraction 
the Pintos kernel creates).  Also, a name that appears in
both the kernel and the user program will actually refer to the kernel
name.  (The latter problem can be avoided by giving the user executable
name on the GDB command line, instead of @file{kernel.o}, and then using
@code{loadusersymbols} to load @file{kernel.o}.)
@code{loadusersymbols} is implemented via GDB's @code{add-symbol-file}
command.

@subsection FAQ

@table @asis
@item GDB can't connect to QEMU (Error: localhost:1234: Connection refused)

If the @command{target remote} command fails, then make sure that both
GDB and @command{pintos} are running on the same machine by
running @command{hostname} in each terminal.  If the names printed
differ, then you need to open a new terminal for GDB on the
machine running @command{pintos}.

@item GDB doesn't recognize any of the macros.

If you start GDB with @command{pintos-gdb}, it should load the Pintos
macros automatically.  If you start GDB some other way, then you must
issue the command @code{source @var{pintosdir}/src/misc/gdb-macros},
where @var{pintosdir} is the root of your Pintos directory, before you
can use them.

@item Can I debug Pintos with DDD?

Yes, you can.  DDD invokes GDB as a subprocess, so you'll need to tell
it to invokes @command{pintos-gdb} instead:
@example
ddd --gdb --debugger pintos-gdb
@end example

@item Can I use GDB inside Emacs?

Yes, you can.  Emacs has special support for running GDB as a
subprocess.  Type @kbd{M-x gdb} and enter your @command{pintos-gdb}
command at the prompt.  The Emacs manual has information on how to use
its debugging features in a section titled ``Debuggers.''

@node Triple Faults
@section Triple Faults

When a CPU exception handler, such as a page fault handler, cannot be
invoked because it is missing or defective, the CPU will try to invoke
the ``double fault'' handler.  If the double fault handler is itself
missing or defective, that's called a ``triple fault.''  A triple fault
causes an immediate CPU reset.

Thus, if you get yourself into a situation where the machine reboots in
a loop, that's probably a ``triple fault.''  In a triple fault
situation, you might not be able to use @func{printf} for debugging,
because the reboots might be happening even before everything needed for
@func{printf} is initialized.

Currently, the only option is ``debugging by infinite loop.''
Pick a place in the Pintos code, insert the infinite loop
@code{for (;;);} there, and recompile and run.  There are two likely
possibilities:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The machine hangs without rebooting.  If this happens, you know that
the infinite loop is running.  That means that whatever caused the
reboot must be @emph{after} the place you inserted the infinite loop.
Now move the infinite loop later in the code sequence.

@item
The machine reboots in a loop.  If this happens, you know that the
machine didn't make it to the infinite loop.  Thus, whatever caused the
reboot must be @emph{before} the place you inserted the infinite loop.
Now move the infinite loop earlier in the code sequence.
@end itemize

If you move around the infinite loop in a ``binary search'' fashion, you
can use this technique to pin down the exact spot that everything goes
wrong.  It should only take a few minutes at most.

@section Tips

The page allocator in @file{threads/palloc.c} and the block allocator in
@file{threads/malloc.c} clear all the bytes in memory to
@t{0xcc} at time of free.  Thus, if you see an attempt to
dereference a pointer like @t{0xcccccccc}, or some other reference to
@t{0xcc}, there's a good chance you're trying to reuse a page that's
already been freed.  Also, byte @t{0xcc} is the CPU opcode for ``invoke
interrupt 3,'' so if you see an error like @code{Interrupt 0x03 (#BP
Breakpoint Exception)}, then Pintos tried to execute code in a freed page or
block.
